## Industry Collaborators
I'm always excited to connect with new collaborators focused on making a positive impact.  I have previously worked in supply-chain, analytics, healthcare, finance and with some non-profit, and government agencies.

## Prospective Ph.D. Students
If you're a prospective Ph.D. candidate, please apply to our [Ph.D. program in Data Science and Operations](http://www.marshall.usc.edu/phd/fields/iom).  Ph.D. candidates are admitted and funded by the school, not by individual faculty.  Hence, all applications are reviewed by a committee, and my opinion is only one of many.  

Questions about the program (admissions process, logistics, etc.) can be directed to 
* [Me](), the Operations Management Ph.D. Coordinator within DSO
* [Prof. Wen Sun](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/WenGuang-Sun/), the Statistics Ph.D. Program Coordinator within DSO
* [Julie Phaneuf](phaneuf@marshall.usc.edu), Associate Director of all USC Marshall Ph.D. Programs

### Want to work with me specifically?
Please specify in your application that you are interested in working with me, and what types of research problems excite you!

## Existing Ph.D. Students
If you're an existing Ph.D. student (perhaps not at USC Marshall) and want to collaborate on a project, please:

* Check to make sure it's ok with your advisor.
* Take a look at some of my research papers.
* Email me so we can talk about your research so far, and what kinds of problems you want to collaborate on.

<br/>
## Master's and Undergraduate Students
I sometimes have computational projects suitable for *ambitious* Master's and Undergraduate students.  These projects are fairly technical, so an ideal candidate would have

* A **strong** mathematical/quantitative background.
* A **strong** working knowledge of mathematical optimization including convex optimization and duality.
* **Strong** programming skills (Julia, Python R, or other).  Ideally, you would be comfortable using software to solve custom optimization problems.

If that's you, please email me!  Please include details about 
 - Why you want to do a research project
 - Your coursework in optimization and data science 
 - Your experience with programming
 - Any research ideas or problems
