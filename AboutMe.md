Before joining USC, I completed my B.A. in Mathematics and Philosophy at Yale University, graduating Magna Cum Laude with honors, and completed Part III of the Mathematics Tripos at the University of Cambridge with distinction. I then spent four years working as a “quant” in finance at Barclays Capital, focusing on commodities modeling, derivatives pricing, and risk management. 
Eventually, I realized how much I missed working towards a larger mission of impact, and left the private sector to complete my Ph.D. in Operations Research at MIT in 2014 under my fantastic advisor [Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas](https://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/). 

My research focuses on data-driven decision-making and optimization, particularly in settings where data are scarce.  
Such settings are common in applications that center on personalization/customization and adapting to changing environments in real-time.  Consequently, my research spans a wide variety of areas including risk and revenue management, education, healthcare, and business analytics.  I have been fortunate enough to receive a number of recognitions for my work, including finalist for the Pierskalla Best Paper competition, finalist for the Service Science Best Paper competition, and finalist for the George Nicholson Best Student Paper competition.
