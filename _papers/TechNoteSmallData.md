This technical note provides an alternate proof of Gupta and Rusmevichientong (2021, Theorem 4.3). The proof presented here is more general, and substantively simpler. It hinges on a new approach to bounding the dependence between different components of the solution of a random linear optimization problem by considering worst-case dual realizations.
