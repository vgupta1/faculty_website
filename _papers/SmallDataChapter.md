(This is an invited chapter to a edited book from Springer.)

This chapter introduces the small-data,large-scale optimization regime, an asymptotic setting that arguably better describes certain data-driven optimization applications than the more traditional large-sample regime.  We highlight unique phenomena that emerge in the small-data, large-scale regime, and show how these phenomena cause certain traditional data-drivenoptimization algorithms like sample average approximation (SAA) ot fail.  We then propose a new debiasing approach that has provably good performance in this regime, highlighting a new path forward for researhch and development into these types of applications.
