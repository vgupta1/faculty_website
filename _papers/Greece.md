In collaboration with the Greek government, we designed and deployed a nation-wide COVID-19 screening protocol for travelers to Greece.  The goals of the protocol were to combine limited demographic information about arriving travelers with screening results from recently tested travelers to i) judiciously allocate Greece's limited testing budget to identify asymptomatic, infected travelers and ii) quickly identify hotspots and spikes in other nations to inform immigration/border policies in real-time.  This paper details i) the operations of our designed system (including border screening, database management, closed-loop feedback, and liasing with contact-tracing teams) ii) a novel, batched, contextual bandit algorithm tailored to the unique features of this problem and iii) an empirical assessment of the benefits of the deployed system from the summer/fall 2020.  

While the paper is still in progress, open-source code with a brief overview of the algorithm is available above.
