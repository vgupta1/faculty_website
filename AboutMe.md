Before joining USC, Vishal completed his B.A. in Mathematics and Philosophy from Yale University, graduating Magna Cum Laude with honors, and completed Part III of the Mathematics Tripos at the University of Cambridge with distinction. He then spent four years working as a “quant” in finance at Barclays Capital focusing on commodities modeling, derivatives pricing and risk management. 
Eventually, realizing how much he missed working towards a larger mission of impact, Vishal left the private sector to complete his Ph.D. in Operations Research at MIT in 2014 under [Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas](https://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/). 

Vishal's research focuses on data-driven decision-making and optimization, particularly in settings where data are scarce or high-dimensional.  His research spans applications including risk and revenue management, education, healthcare and business analytics.  He has received a number of recognitions for his work including Finalist for the Pierskalla Best paper competition, Finalist for the George Nicholson Best student paper competition, and Finalist for the Service Science Best paper award.
