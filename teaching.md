## Case Materials

I developed these cases as part *BUAD 425: Data Analysis for Decision Making* (below).  They not only illustrate various data-analysis techniques, but also teach students to integrate data analysis with more qualitative judgements to guide decision-making.  

Please contact me directly for the associated datasets, example code, and teaching notes.

* **BUAD 425 Data Analysis for Decision Making**, 2014-2018, Undergraduate Core.
  * Curriculum Development (2014), Instructor (2015, 2017)
  * **Awarded the 2016 Evan C. Teaching and Learning Innovation Award for the redesign of this course.** 
  * [Course Description](https://classes.usc.edu/term-20171/course/buad-425) - Every aspect of the firm -- organizational structure, marketing, product design, and strategic planning â€“ is shifting towards data-driven decision-making.  The goal of this course is to help you develop your skills as a data-savvy manager.  To that end, we study several basic analytics techniques, focusing on how to apply them in practice, interpret their output, build intuition, and leverage them in decision-making.

<br/>
* **BUAD 311 Introduction to Operations Management**, 2014, 2018-Present, Undergraduate Core.
  * Instructor (2014, 2018-Present)
  * [Course Description](http://web-app.usc.edu/ws/soc_archive/soc/term-20151/course/buad-311/) - Fundamentals of operations management. Skills needed to analyze, manage, and improve business processes. Topics include: process, capacity, service, and inventory management and optimization.

<br/>
### MIT / MIT Sloan

* **15.S60 Software Tools for Operations Researchers**, IAP 2013-2014, Ph.D. and Graduate Elective. 
  * Instructor (2013), Curriculum Development (2013-2014) 
  * This is a student-run and taught class focusing on developing hands-on skills with data-analysis and optimization software.  I was involved in the original course proposal, curriculum development and have taught the course previously.  In 2014, several co-instructors and I co-authored [a paper](Papers/SoftwareTools.pdf) documenting the course design and sharing materials.  Since then, it has remained a continued part of MIT's Operations Research Ph.D. program, and several other schools have developed similar courses using our templated materials.
