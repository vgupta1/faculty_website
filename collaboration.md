### Industry Collaborators
I'm always excited to connect with new collaborators focused on making a positive impact.  I have previously worked in supply-chain, analytics, healthcare, finance and with some non-profit, government agencies.  Please send me an email to schedule a meeting!


<br/>
### Prospective and Existing Ph.D. Students
If you're a prospective Ph.D. candidate, please apply to our [Ph.D. program in Data Science and Operations](http://www.marshall.usc.edu/phd/fields/iom).  Please specify in your application that you are interested in working with me, and what types of research problems excite you!

Ph.D. candidates are admitted and funded by the school, not by individual faculty.  Consequently, all applications are reviewed by a committee, and my opinion is only one of many.  Questions about the Ph.D. program should be directed to the Coordinator, 
[Prof. Wen Sun](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/WenGuang-Sun/)
or the OM Ph.D. program coordinator
[Prof. Greys Sosic](http://www.marshall.usc.edu/faculty/directory/sosic).

If you're an existing Ph.D. student and want to collaborate on a project, please:

* Check to make sure it's ok with your advisor.
* Take a look at some of my research papers.
* Email me so we can talk about your research so far, and what kinds of problems you want to collaborate on.

<br/>
### Master's and Undergraduate Students
I sometimes have computational projects suitable for *ambitious* Master's and Undergraduate students.  These projects are fairly technical, so an ideal candidate would have

* A **strong** mathematical/quantitative background.
* A **strong** working knowledge of mathematical optimization including convex optimization and duality.
* **Strong** programming skills (Julia, Python R, or other).  Ideally, you would be comfortable using software to solve custom optimization problems.

If that's you, please email me!  Please include details about 
 - Why you want to do a research project
 - Your coursework in optimization and data science 
 - Your experience with programming
 - Any research ideas or problems
