Please feel free to use/adapt these materials in your own classes.  If you do, please let me know as I like to know they're helping others!  Please also contact me directly for the associated datasets, example code, and teaching notes that I only share with other faculty.

## Data Analysis for Decision Making

* USC Marshall, Undergraduate Core (Business Majors)
* Curriculum Development (2014), Instructor (2015, 2017) 
* Awarded the **2016 Evan C. Teaching and Learning Innovation Award for the redesign of this course.** 
* [Syllabus](/Papers/Buad425_Syllabus.pdf)

Course Description: Every aspect of the firm -- organizational structure, marketing, product design, and strategic planning – is shifting towards data-driven decision-making.  The goal of this course is to help you develop your skills as a data-savvy manager.  To that end, we study several basic analytics techniques, focusing on how to apply them in practice, interpret their output, build intuition, and leverage them in decision-making.


### Case Materials
The above course centers on a case studies.  I develooped these case studies not only to illustrate various data-analysis techniques, but also to teach students how to integrate data analysis with more qualitative judgements to guide decision-making.

Course Description: 
Evidence-based decision-making is becoming ever-more crucial in our world.  But where does such evidence come from?  In most cases, it stems from research -- conducted by us or by others.  <!-- Said another way, the modern world requires us both to produce research and to consume research produced by others.  
 --> We produce and consume research both when considering global, “wicked” problems such as “How can we root out systemic racism?” and also in the minutia of day-to-day life, such as “Which webcam should I buy for online teaching?” Moreover, with the increasing prevalence of misinformation and “fake news,” our success hinges not only on our ability to synthesize data, but to critically distinguish good data from bad and bad data from outright lies.  

This research seminar focuses on developing the skills to be an effective researcher, and to communicate that research effectively.  Along the way we will discuss the ways that research exists inside and outside academia, and how it supports various industries in achieving their goals.  The primary deliverable and goal for the seminar is to develop (over the course of the semester) a viable research proposal for an undergraduate thesis.  


### Selected Thesis Proposals
My inaugural 2021 class was entirely online because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Nonetheless, they produced some amazing thesis proposals.  Browse the abstracts (posted with permission) below.

## Stochastic Foundations of Prescriptive Analytics
* USC Marshall, PhD Core Class
* Curriculum Development (2020), Instructor (2021) 
* [Syllabus](/Papers/Syllabus_Stochastics_2021.pdf)

Course Description: 
This is a Ph.D. level lecture course covering the core probability theory and stochastic analysis necessary for modeling and analysis in data-driven optimization, a.k.a., prescriptive analytics. The goal of this course is to provide students with a rigorous theoretical background to enable them to pursue their own research in these areas. This course is not meant as a first course in probability theory nor a formal treatment of measure-theoretic probability. Rather, the focus is on the probability tools most commonly used to analyze algorithms in data-driven optimization, machine learning, and personalization.
