The Black-Litterman (BL) model is a widely used asset allocation model in the financial industry. In this paper, we provide
a new perspective. The key insight is to replace the statistical framework in the original approach with ideas from inverse
optimization. This insight allows us to significantly expand the scope and applicability of the BL model. We provide a
richer formulation that, unlike the original model, is flexible enough to incorporate investor information on volatility and
market dynamics. Equally importantly, our approach allows us to move beyond the traditional mean-variance paradigm of
the original model and construct “BL”-type estimators for more general notions of risk such as coherent risk measures.
Computationally, we introduce and study two new “BL”-type estimators and their corresponding portfolios: a mean variance
inverse optimization (MV-IO) portfolio and a robust mean variance inverse optimization (RMV-IO) portfolio. These two
approaches are motivated by ideas from arbitrage pricing theory and volatility uncertainty. Using numerical simulation
and historical backtesting, we show that both methods often demonstrate a better risk-reward trade-off than their BL
counterparts and are more robust to incorrect investor views.
